Feature: Catalog Home Page
  In order to make sure the site is working
  As any user
  I want to be able to view the home page

  Scenario:
    Given I am on the home page
    Then I should see "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Library and Archives"
    And I should see "Format"
    And I should see "Archival Material"
    And I should see "Archival Collection"
    And I should see "Topic"

                <title render="italic">Poetic License: In Poem and Song</title> without the illustrations by David Soto; three negatives and ten original photographs from various stages of Mayfield's solo career and his time with The Impressions, all circa 1958 to the early-1990s--there are three oversize photographic reproductions in the collection as well. The collection also contains a Curtis Mayfield poster from an April 6, 1990 concert in Barcelona, Spain and two concert programs: one with Curtis Mayfield and the Superfly Band for a 1979 tour of South Africa; the other, the 1983 Silver Anniversary Tour of the Impressions. The collection provides a glimpse into the career of Curtis Mayfield through images, his lyrics, and poetry. Seen in a broader context, the collection provides insights to the changing rhythm and blues scene from the late-1950s into the 1990s.</abstract>

            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Curtis Lee Mayfield (June 3, 1942–December 26, 1999) was a singer, songwriter, and record producer primarily in the rhythm and blues, soul, and funk genres. He was born on the North Side of Chicago and was performing by the age 7. He quickly gained an appreciation for the gospel and electric blues music found in the Chicago area and by his teens had taught himself to play the electric guitar. Ultimately, he would become a multi-instrumentalist who played the guitar, bass, piano, saxophone, and drums. After leaving school at the age of 16 to pursue his music career, Mayfield score his first hit (“For Your Precious Love”) with his band, The Impressions. By the 1970s, Mayfield had gone solo and had his own record label, Curtom Records, and was creating his most commercially successful record, the soundtrack to the “blaxploitation” film Superfly. Songs from the album include the title track and “Freddie’s Dead,”and the album is still considered an influential landmark of the period. Through the decade, Mayfield and the artists on Curtom Records would be disturbed by different labels, including Buddah Records, Warner Bros., RSO Records, and Artista. The label ceased to exist by 1980 and its master tapes are now controlled by Warner Music Group and the Mayfield Family Mayfield continued making albums, writing soundtracks, and performing live over the next two decades. Unfortunately, during a soundcheck on August 13, 1990 at an outdoor concert venue, Mayfield was crushed under the stage lighting rig, which had toppled from the high winds, crushing his spine in three places, and leaving him paralyzed from the neck down and unable to play any instrument. But, he was still able to sing, and continued to writing and produce new material for his 1997 album, “New World Order.” Mayfield was awarded the Grammy Legend Award in 1994 and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. He was also inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Impressions in 1991 and as a solo artist in 1999. Curtis Mayfield passed away at the age of 57 on December 26, 1999.</p>

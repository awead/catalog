            <abstract id="ref2" label="Collection Overview">The T.E. Newsletter, created by DJ Tommy Edwards, was the first of its kind published in the music industry, describing the weekly events at WERE-AM, Cleveland, Ohio. The newsletter included what artists had visited the station and which records looked promising. The newsletter was distributed to over two hundred agency men, music publishers, columnists, and disc jockeys from coast to coast. The T.E. Newsletter offers a slice of the "Cleveland scene" during the 1950s and illustrates the cityâ€™s influence at the time on the marketing and dissemination of rock and roll. The T.E. Newsletter is a part of the Terry Stewart Collection. It is arranged by date of publication.</abstract>

            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Born Thomas Edward Mull on March 21, 1921, Tommy Edwards began his radio career in 1945. In April 1951, he accepted a job as staff announcer at WERE-AM, Cleveland's most listened to radio station. Within three months, he became the host of his own daily pop music show; eventually becoming one of Cleveland's best known radio personalities. In 1955, Edwards was the first Cleveland disc jockey to play Elvis Presley on air with "Blue Moon of Kentucky." It was also during 1955 that Edwards brought Presley to Cleveland to perform four different times, on February 26, March 28, August 20, and October 19. The world famous image of Presley with Bill Haley was in fact taken by Edwards at Brooklyn High School in Ohio the day after Presley's October concert at the Circle Theater. In addition, Edwards was credited with discovering country star Dottie West. Edwards was also a recording artist in his own right. On the Coral label, he sold over 100,000 copies of his song "What is a Teenage Girl?" and recorded such tunes as "What is Rock N' Roll" and "The Story of Elvis Presley." Edwards died in 1981.</p>
            <p>In 2006, a wealth of candid photographs that Edwards had taken of artists while at WERE-AM were discovered. Edwards' photography captured some of the 1950s' biggest pop and country music stars, including Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Roy Orbison, and hundreds of others. These images and some of the text from the T.E. Newsletter were published in a book, 1950s Radio in Color: The Lost Photographs of Deejay Tommy Edwards, and exhibited in the spring of 2012 by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum under the same title.</p>

                    <p>Volume V is missing issue number 35. Issue numbers 40 and 41 are also missing, but it is unclear if these issues were ever printed.

There are no such sheets of letterhead in this collection for issues 40 and 41, but Edwards does state prior to these issues that he was going on vacation.</p>

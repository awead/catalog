            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Henry Diltz is a world-renowned photographer and founding member of the Modern Folk Quartet (MFQ). Diltz, who is as much at home as a musician on tour, is a visual historian of the last four decades of popular music. The rapport he’s developed with his musician friends enables him to capture candid shots that convey a rare feeling of trust and intimacy with his subjects</p>
            <p>For Diltz, the pictures began with a $20 second-hand Japanese camera purchased on tour with the MFQ. When the group disbanded, Diltz embarked on his photographic career with an album cover for The Lovin’ Spoonful. Despite his lack of formal training, he easily submerged himself in the world of rock photography.</p>
            <p>For over 40 years, his work has graced hundreds of album covers and has been featured in books, magazines, and newspapers. His unique artistic style has produced powerful photographic essays of Woodstock , The Monterey Pop Festival, The Doors, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, Jimi Hendrix, and scores of other legendary artists. Diltz continues his distinguished career, generating new and vibrant photographs that inspire the rock and roll fan in each of us.</p>
            <p>Henry Diltz is a partner in, and is exclusively published and represented by, the Morrison Hotel Gallery.</p>

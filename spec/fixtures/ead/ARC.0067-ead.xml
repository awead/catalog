            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Curtis Lee Mayfield (June 3, 1942–December 26, 1999) was a singer, songwriter, and record producer primarily in the rhythm and blues, soul, and funk genres. He was born on the North Side of Chicago and was performing by the age 7. He quickly gained an appreciation for the gospel and electric blues music found in the Chicago area, and by his teens had taught himself to play the electric guitar. Ultimately, he would become a multi-instrumentalist, who played the guitar, bass, piano, saxophone, and drums. After leaving school at the age of 16 to pursue his music career, Mayfield scored his first hit (“For Your Precious Love”) with his band, The Impressions. By the 1970s, Mayfield had gone solo and had his own record label, Curtom Records, and was creating his most commercially successful record, the soundtrack to the “blaxploitation” film 
                <title render="italic">Superfly</title>. Mayfield continued making albums, writing soundtracks, and performing live over the next two decades. Due to an accident in 1990, Mayfield was paralyzed from the neck down and unable to play an instrument, but her could still sing and continued to write and produce new material. Mayfield was awarded the Grammy Legend Award in 1994 and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. He was also inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Impressions in 1991, and as a solo artist in 1999. Curtis Mayfield passed away at the age of 57 on December 26, 1999.</p>
